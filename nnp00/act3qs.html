                <P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Tahoma, Helvetica" SIZE="2">You
                  can choose this task if you find a family for which you have
                  access to grandparents, parents and children, or at least to
                  their photographs. The idea is to scan three pictures and
                  place them side by side, each one representing one generation.
                  What countries did each generation live in? What insights can
                  you get by comparing the photographs? Here are two examples of
                  how to choose your set of photographs:</FONT></P>

                <P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Tahoma, Helvetica" SIZE="2">Often
                  the urban environment people live in when they migrate is very
                  different from the one they left behind, or from what they
                  expected to find. Can you capture some aspects of their new
                  neighborhood as the starting point of a comparison with the
                  old neighborhood? Through very short, objective descriptions,
                  one or two photographs and maybe even a fragment of a map, you
                  can capture some aspects of the environment in which the
                  family or person lives. What does the building they live in
                  look like, where do they shop, what kind of people are their
                  neighbors?</FONT></P>

                  some of the forces that lead to migration? If so, you can try
                  to write a short paragraph which systematically records the
                  main facts of their migration history up to the present: in
                  what places did the different generations live? Why did they
