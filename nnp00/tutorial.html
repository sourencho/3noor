            <P>The Internet is the world's largest computer network. It is an
              interconnected, spiderweb-like system of millions of computer
              networks linked with telecommunications software and hardware,
              based on a set of standard technologies.</P>
            
            <P>The connection process to the Internet is the following: A
              personal computer (client) with a graphical user interface such as
              Windows or MacOS runs a program (browser) that downloads data from
              another computer connected to the network (server).</P>
            
            <P>A protocol is a set of rules for how computers can communicate
              with each other. The Internet Protocol is the set of rules for how
              computers can communicate over the Internet. Until late 1993, the
              Internet's unexciting, text-based appearance and confusing
              commands were too impractical for everyday use by non-experts.
              However, the Internet's development has been spectacular since
              then. Advances in the software used to navigate the Internet have
              opened its vast potential to anyone that is interested in
              exploring its multimedia features. The Internet offers an easy and
              fast exchange of information between the different users of the
              network. The main services available on the Internet are:</P>

            <P>Today, the World Wide Web (WWW or just the &quot;Web&quot;) is
              the fastest growing, most exciting component of the Internet. It
              almost re-invented the concept of how people can use the Internet.
              Fully graphical, including text, graphics, video, and sound, the
              Web gives users the ability to simply click on a word or graphic
              to travel to another computer anywhere on the Internet. Each page,
              or site on the web, has a unique address, referred to as a URL
              (Universal Resource Locator). The WWW service, together with
              email, is the most popular service used for the distribution and
              exchange of information over the Internet.</P>
            
            <H3>Use of Web browsers</H3>
            
            <P>An important element of the web system is the browser. A browser
              is a software tool or program that looks (browses) at various
              kinds of Internet resources such as the Web. Browsers are
              available in text-only or fully graphical versions.</P>
            
            <P>Most of the computers connected to the network have new or old
              versions of the most popular graphical programs such as Netscape
              Navigator or Microsoft Internet Explorer. The fact that Internet
              standards are applied by consensus and leave room for
              interpretation makes Web pages appear differently to different
              users. Improvements in browsers are taking place at a rapid pace,
              and the competition between browser makers has resulted in the
              evolution from a simple web client, to packages which include an
              email client, news client, software for collaboration from a
              distance, and Web page authoring tools. This is the case of the
              new versions of the two main browsers Netscape Communicator 4.0
              and Microsoft Internet Explorer 4.0.</P>
            
            <H3>A Word or two about email</H3>
            
            <P>Email (electronic mail) is the most widely used online tool. It
              allows you to send and receive messages over the Internet. </P>
            
            <P>Because the person to whom you send email doesn't have to be
              connected at that moment, your outgoing message can be carefully
              composed offline, delivered instantly and even sent at specific
              times. People who aren't even &quot;on the Internet&quot; can send
              and receive email. Anybody with an account with a commercial
              online service is a potential recipient of an email message. Email
              can be used for sending messages to one or a few people at a time,
              but it can also be used for large group discussions by subscribing
              to a discussion list.</P>
            
            <H3>Sending email</H3>
            
            <P>This is a detail of what an email composition window looks like
              on Netscape Navigator 3.0 for the Macintosh. Other programs will
              have a slightly different appearance but should contain the same
              basic information.</P> <IMG SRC="../tutilu1.gif" WIDTH="315" HEIGHT="226">
            
            <P>To send email, you should access your email software and choose
              the option that allows you to &quot;compose&quot; your message.</P>
            <UL TYPE="SQUARE">
              <LI> &quot;Mail To&quot; : type in the email address of the

                the top right corner of the message area and start typing. When
                you are done typing, either you can click on the button for
                sending or you can choose deferred delivery and postpone sending
                your message. </LI>

            <P>When you have mail waiting to be read, your mail program will
              display a list of pending messages. This should show you which
              messages are new, and which are unread. Depending on your program,
              you might see the name of the sender, the date it was sent on and
              its subject.</P>

              Here are two fictitious examples: vahan@arax.prov.fr,
              nacci@linker.net.</P>
            
            <P>Addresses have the form user@domain.</P>
            
            <P>user ID = personal user name of a specific recipient at that
              domain (i.e. vahan or nacci)</P>
            
            <P>host = name of a specific computer (i.e. arax)</P>
            
            <P>domain name = where a group of recipients do their email
              transactions (i.e. arax.prov.fr: a domain in France, or
              linker.net: an Internet Service Provider called Linker)</P>
            
            <P>top level domain = the group of letters after the last &quot;.&quot;

            <P>Most email addresses are case insensitive, meaning that it
              doesn't matter whether you type in upper or lower case. Experts
              advise, however, that you type an address exactly as it appears.</P>
            
            <P>* Some email programs let you attach a file (i.e. a word
              processor document) to your email message. However you may run
              into some problems if the recipient is not able to open the kind

              incorrect address.</P>
            
            <P>&quot;User unknown&quot;: There is probably a typo in the

            <P>&quot;Mail can't be delivered&quot;: Usually the server will try

              Web page or Usenet. AltaVista provides both simple and advanced
              searches. Advanced searches include all the features of simple
              ones, in addition to the use of Boolean and proximity operators,
              grouping of terms, and results ranking by keyword.</P>

              either by keyword or by concept (you can choose which way you
              would like to search.) Concept searches find documents related to
              the idea of your search, and not just documents explicitly
              containing the search terms you enter.</P>

            <P>WebCrawler searches for documents within a website that matches
              your search terms, not just websites as a whole. While directories
              such as Yahoo refer to sites that cover the category subject you
              are interested in, WebCrawler searches the contents of pages
              within a site, and for a match with the search terms you entered,
              even if the site itself is unrelated to what you are searching
              for. It builds an impressively complete index and does a good job
              of sorting the documents it finds according to how closely they
              match your search items. However, because it indexes the contents
              of documents, it may also find many links that you're not
              interested in. WebCrawler also includes a catalog of
              pre-classified subjects (directory services).</P>
