            the interview. Preferably, it will have two or three generations
            living together or close to each other. Start looking for the family
            as soon as possible. Take their picture, or borrow a family
            photograph, scan it, and email it to the other teams in your group.
            And make sure you send a copy to me too (aren@narod.org).

            email those questions to each of the teams in your group as well as
            to me. As soon as we all have each other's questions, we will come
            up with ways of combining and condensing them into the first part of
            a short interview. Your team will then have to build the second part
            of the interview by adding some questions which are specific to the
            family you have chosen and the circumstances of their migration.
