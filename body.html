       The Narod* Network Project aims to unite young Armenian students
      worldwide in a collaborative experience. It will make it possible for
      students from ten different schools to collaborate on specifically
      designed educational tasks during a period of six months. The goal of the
      Three Pomegranates is to become a prototype for conducting joint educational
      activities among primary and secondary schools in different locations in
      Armenia and in Armenian communities around the world. The project consists
      of the following components, the details of which are described in this
      document: </P>
    
    <P></P>
    <UL TYPE="SQUARE">
      <LI>Equipping and training schools, staff and students for effective use
        of information and telecommunications technologies.
        
        <P></P></LI>
      <LI>Constructing a virtual forum on the World Wide Web which will act as
        a point of access and a workspace for the project.
        
        <P></P></LI>
      <LI>Conducting a sequence of three educational activities designed to
        introduce students to the technology, to each other, and to their shared
        Armenian heritage.
        
        <P></P></LI>
      <LI>Insuring the continuity of the effort by maintaining the resulting
        World Wide Web site available both to the participants and to the
        general public. This site will become an evolving forum for young
        Armenians and a platform for launching future projects. </LI>
    </UL>
    
    <P>Through the 3PN we aim to address a number of topics
      of general interest, ranging from issues of content specific to cultures
      with a strong global component to technical matters such as the challenge
      posed by non-Latin alphabets on the Internet. We will address these topics
      by centering our attention on the goal of enhancing the mutual awareness
      of young Armenians and reinforcing their shared culture. </P>
    
    <P>We see great potential in the Internet, and specially the World Wide
      Web, as a platform for the Three Pomegranates . The Internet is recognized as
      an important contributor to an emerging global culture, but it is also
      accused of having a negative homogenizing effect. Our belief is that while
      it brings cultures together, the Internet also has the potential of
      reinforcing minority identities. Bringing Armenian youth together on the
      Internet can be a very natural process. Dispersed around the world but
      sharing increasingly different variations of the same culture, the global
      Armenian community is, in a sense, the other worldwide web. </P>

    <P>The Narod Armenian Children's Cultural Institute is a subsidiary of the
      Ani and Narod Memorial Fund, Inc., a non-profit organization established
      in 1994. The mandate of the e4d institute is to work with the aim of
      bringing joy to the life of every young Armenian in the world, improving
      the educational contexts of childhood and helping young Armenians share
      the Armenian cultural heritage. The Ani and Narod Memorial Fund, was
      established in New York by the Ardhaldjian and Coherian families in memory
      of Ani Coherian Ardhaldjian and her two-year-old daughter Narod. Ani and
      Narod died along with 130 other passengers and crew in the crash of USAir
      flight 427 in Pittsburgh, on September 8, 1994. The foundation is
      committed to helping mothers and children worldwide live healthier and
      more fulfilling lives. To realize these objectives, the fund finances and
      develops programs, often in collaboration with other non-profit
      organizations, in the areas of health care, education, culture, community
      services, and capacity-building. </P>

    <P>During the next several years, the e4d institute will focus most of
      its efforts on meeting the educational and cultural needs of young
      Armenians residing in Armenia and in the Armenian Diaspora by using new
      telecommunications technologies and specially the Internet. We believe

    <P>At the basis of the 3PN are two cultural realities,
      one quite ancient, and the other rather new. The first of these is
      Armenian culture and the second is the culture emerging out of the
      widespread use of global communications networks and the Internet. The
      following sections offer a brief introduction to each of these. </P>
    
    <P><B><FONT FACE="ARIAL" SIZE="3">Armenia and Armenians</FONT></B> </P>
    <HR WIDTH="100%" SIZE="1">
    
    <P>Current Armenia is located in Southern Asia, bordered by Azerbaijan,
      Georgia, Iran and Turkey with a total area of 29,800 sq. Km.. Armenians
      are an ancient people who trace their roots back to the early part of the
      first millennium BC. For long periods, Armenia was an independent nation,
      located primarily in the eastern regions of present-day Turkey, and the
      ancient history of Armenia includes a short-lived empire under Tigran II
      (95-55 BC) which was ended by a Roman invasion. Present day Armenia
      comprises only 10 percent of the nation's historic territory. In 1915, a
      large segment of the Armenian population was either killed by the Young
      Ottoman government (about one and a half million Armenians), or deported
      into the Syrian desert, from where the Armenian Diaspora was scattered
      around the world. </P>
    
    <P>The Russian part of Armenia was revived as an independent state on May
      28, 1918. This state did not last long and was taken over by the
      Bolsheviks. The current Republic of Armenia declared independence from the
      Soviet Union on September 21, 1991. </P>
    
    <P>The Armenian language is an independent branch of the Indo-European
      group, with a unique alphabet which was created in 405 reaffirming the
      national identity. There are currently two major dialects of Armenian in
      use today: Most of the Armenian Diaspora speaks Western Armenian, while in
      Armenia proper and in the Armenian community in Iran, the dialect called
      Eastern Armenian is used. The differences are relatively trivial and
      center mostly around pronunciation. Given adequate motivation, a speaker
      of one dialect can learn the other quickly. Armenians are also the oldest
      Christian nation. The introduction of Christianity is ascribed to St.
      Gregory the Illuminator, who converted the pagan Armenian sovereign Trdat
      III in 301 AD. </P>
    
    <P>The members of the Armenian Diaspora and Armenians in Armenia are
      conceptually united by a common heritage and by the &quot;ian&quot;
      suffix. Most Armenian family names end in &quot;ian&quot;. There are a few
      exceptions, such as Pakradouni, Ardzrouni and Rshdouni, as well as many
      Armenians who have either adopted non-Armenian family names, or have
      replaced the &quot;ian&quot; in an effort of integration
      (Kasparian/Kasparov) or removed it (Aznavourian/Aznavour) for the sake of
      internationalization. Of course not all family names that ends in &quot;ian&quot;
      are Armenian, a notable case being a number of Persian family names with
      that ending. </P>
    
    <P>The Armenians are a mobile, as well as widely scattered people, so it
      has always been very hard to establish the total world population of
      Armenians. All counts are based on estimates and on the records of the
      Armenian Church, since many Armenians baptize their children in church,
      thus registering their names. </P>
    
    <P>Today, various estimates place the number of Armenians in the world
      around seven and a half million. Three million of those seven and a half
      live in Armenia while two and a half million are scattered across the rest
      of the former Soviet Union. Another million live throughout the United
      States, with the largest concentration in Los Angeles, and then New York,
      Boston and other major cities. One million are spread out across the rest
      of the world with large concentrations in Canada (50,000), South America
      (50,000) the Near and Middle East (420,000), Eastern and Western Europe
      (500,000), and Australia (20,000). </P>
    
    <P>An Armenian magazine published in Vienna in July 1975 declared: &quot;Ils
      sont 7 000 000 dans le monde qui disent AYO&quot; (&quot;Seven million
      people in the world say AYO&quot;&#151;Ayo being the Armenian word for &quot;yes&quot;).
      Official Soviet Statistics quoted an estimate of the population of Soviet
      Armenia at 3,317,000 (1985 figures) of which almost three million are
      ethnic Armenians. </P>

    <P><I>USA and Canada</I>
      <BR> There are approximately 30 Armenian all-day schools in the US and
      Canada (in California, Massachusetts, Michigan, New York, New Jersey,
      Pennsylvania, Ontario, Quebec...) which go from pre-school to high school.
      As for Saturday and Sunday one-day schools, there are 80 and 65 schools
      respectively, scattered around the United States and Canada. </P>

      <BR> In Lebanon there are 37 all-day schools (and one college,) mostly
      concentrated in the capital Beirut, with more than 10,000 students among
      them. Syria has 41 all-day schools with more than 14,000 students, mainly
      in the city of Aleppo, which has a large Armenian population. In Iran
      there are 30 schools. In Turkey, eight schools. One main operating all day
      school in Cyprus and three high schools in Egypt (one in Alexandria and
      two in Cairo) with a few schools in Jordan and Israel. </P>
    
    <P><I>Australia</I>
      <BR> Two all-day schools can be found in Australia. </P>
    
    <P>In June 1996, a &quot;Diaspora Armenian Educational Symposium&quot; was
      organized in Nice, France attended by more than thirty representatives
      from Armenian schools all over the world. The goal of the meeting was to
      work towards finding a method for the unification of Armenian educational
      material and curriculums in the world. Unfortunately, for economical and
      technical reasons, this international meeting did not take place the
      following year as expected. School representatives were asked to meet in
      their own countries and report their annual activities and conclusions to
      the organizing committee later on. Both the motivation and the
      difficulties associated with this symposium and with similar efforts
      reinforce the need for an effective and flexible forum, based on
      telecommunications technologies, aimed at bringing Armenian educational
      institutions, their staff and their students closer together. </P>
    
    <P><B><FONT FACE="ARIAL" SIZE="3">The Internet, the world's knowledge

    <HR WIDTH="100%" SIZE="1">
    
    <P>According to the Educator's Internet Companion (Wentworth Worldwide
      Media, Inc. 1996) we are witnessing the greatest explosion of change to
      affect the field of education in decades, perhaps in all history. This
      change is the Internet. It is hard to define the Internet in a few
      sentences. Technically, the Net is an interconnected, spider web-like
      system of millions of computer networks linked with telecommunications
      software and hardware. To the people who use it, the Internet is the sum
      of all individuals and institutions that connect their computers to other
      computers anywhere in the world with devices called modems. A computer
      with a modem can plug into any phone line, and that simple connection is
      enough to bring together people and information around the world via the
      Internet. </P>
    
    <P>Advances in the software used to navigate the Internet have opened its
      vast potential to even the most computer-phobic. In particular, the World
      Wide Web, known as the &quot;Web&quot;, is the fastest growing, most
      exciting component of the Internet. Fully multi-media, including text,
      graphics, video, and sound. Web &quot;browser&quot; software such as
      Netscape and Microsoft Explorer have given computer users around the world
      access to millions of documents on the Internet. This new type of software
      is so simple, anyone who can maneuver a mouse already knows how to use it.
      With a simple click, its &quot;hypertext&quot; capability immediately
      presents you with information located on computers throughout the world.
    </P>
    
    <P>Using the Internet, we can teach students to search, retrieve, collect,
      and exchange information. More important, they will learn to analyze,
      write about, and then publish information on any imaginable topic. This
      cycle of information gathering, analyzing, writing and publishing is
      important in the new information age already upon us. From elementary
      school to high school, from school-to-work programs to higher education,
      teaching the value of the Internet will be a key component to success and
      achievement in the job market of the future. </P>

    <HR WIDTH="100%" SIZE="1">
    
    <P>EIFG, classroom connect (Wentworth Worldwide Media, Inc. 1997)
      identifies the three dramatic changes that access to the Internet provides
      to schools: </P>
    
    <P> </P>
    
    <P><B>1 </B>The Internet breaks down classroom walls, bringing students
      and teachers into contact with people and places they would otherwise
      never have met or visited. Teachers, often isolated in their classrooms,
      suddenly have immediate access to thousands of colleges. The classes, and
      indeed, the schools they attend, suddenly become connected, and the
      barrier of distance disappears. </P>
    
    <P> <B>2 </B> The Internet dramatically expands classroom resources by
      making the latest information, graphic images, and software available at
      the click of a mouse. These resources yield individual and group projects,
      collaboration, curriculum and lesson plan materials, and an increased
      level of idea sharing found only in schools with on-line access. </P>
    
    <P> <B>3 </B> Internet use encourages independent, autonomous learning,
      which most educators agree helps students become lifelong learners. </P>
    
    <P><B><FONT FACE="ARIAL" SIZE="3">Why the Internet for an Armenian
      project?</FONT></B> </P>
    <HR WIDTH="100%" SIZE="1">
    
    <P>The Internet is recognized as an important factor in creating and
      reinforcing a global culture. This unifying instrument, often sited as one
      of the most positive developments of new telecommunications technologies,
      is also accused of having a negative homogenizing effect. But the
      Internet, while acting as a forum for the encounter of cultures, also has
      the potential of reinforcing each of them. We believe that it is precisely
      those cultures most in danger of disappearing through assimilation into
      more predominant local identities, which have most to gain by building a
      global critical mass. Armenians have existed in a globally dispersed state
      for many generations. We are convinced that this project will contribute
      to the unification of the different manifestations of Armenian culture,
      and that it will help demonstrate the potential of the Internet for
      sustaining heterogeneous identities. </P>
    
    <P>A prime objective of this more fluent communication between Armenians is
      to bring the intellectual and human resources of Diaspora Armenians to the
      Armenian state, providing it with a permanent source of support. At the
      same time Diaspora Armenians can benefit from this virtual connection with
      the physical source of their cultural heritage. Armenia has a demographic
      density of Armenians and a level of Armenian cultural activity unequaled
      anywhere in the Diaspora. It also has a future as a national entity, which
      is much more long-term than that of any given Armenian organization. A
      very large number of Armenians have never been to Armenia and know little
      about what it means to live there, yet most consider Armenia their other
      homeland. This project aims to explore how Diaspora Armenian students and
      students in Armenia can contribute to the development of Armenia and
      Armenians and ensure the healthy progress of Armenian culture and
      education. </P>

      that package. </P>
    
    <P> <B>1 </B>Setting up the technical infrastructure: This task consists
      of, but is not limited to, setting up the networking infrastructure,
      selecting and contracting a networking service provider in each country,
      selecting server software, installing computers at end user locations and
      testing the network. </P>

      together with I&#149; EARN (the International Education and Resource
      Network is a not-for-profit corporation dedicated to assist youth in
      collaborative telecommunications project). It consists of preparing and
      coordinating training courses and courseware material for students and
      teachers. This task includes necessary support during the project
      implementation for the end-user. The schools are conceptually divided into
      two major groups, Group A (Armenia, Lebanon and France) and Group B (USA 
      and Canada). The training course will be held separately for each group,
      however the technical support during the course of the project will be
      offered locally. </P>

      project activities are divided into three (optionally four) basic
      sections. The subject and main ideas of each activity is specified above.
      The detailing of each activity will be given to different Armenian
      institutions under the management and coordination of the partner
      responsible for that specific task. </P>
    
    <P> <B>4 </B>Armenian/English coordination: This task will include all
      necessary translations back and forth between English and Armenian before,
      during and after the implementation of the project. Examples are the
      teachers' and students' guides (translation to English or Armenian),
      translation of all the schools' results from Armenian to English, etc..

    <P> <B>5 </B>Project structure design and maintenance: This task consists
      of the deployment and subsequent maintenance of the information system
      which will provide a platform for all the activities of the project. This
      includes the design and implementation of a virtual forum for
      collaboration based in the World Wide Web, putting together a software
      tool kit for working in Armenian and English on the Internet and a
      methodology for managing the project workflow at a technical level. </P>

      the project, assure the quality, content and timeliness of results,
      collect information and coordinate all baseline activities and work
      packages, supervise the progression of work, produce deliverables and

        <P>The most important step towards the kind of standardization that

          ensure that all participants receive a package of resources and tools
          that will allow full functionality and compatibility among them. But
          the parts of the project, such as most of its Web site, which are
          accessible from the Internet as a whole, will need to rely on the
          emerging Unicode standard, along with a strategy for making

    <P>The 3PN is a novel innitiative in the work of
      reinforcing and envigorating a global Armenian identity. By bringing young
      Armenian students in Armenia and throughout the Armenian Diaspora closer
      together, the Three Pomegranates aims to become a prototype for distributed
      collaborative projects among Armenian communities. </P>
    
    <P>To its organizers, the 3PN represents a unique
      opportunity to significantly contribute to Armenian cultural awareness,
      and use emerging telecommunications technologies to maintain a valuable
      heritage. To the project participants, the project represents a chance to
      meet young Armenians in different parts of the world, so different from
      them, and yet so similar. For its sponsors, the Three Pomegranates is a model
      and a future platform for effectively carrying out educational efforts
      accross the Armenian landscape, and for reaching out to an increasingly
      larger number of young Armenians now brought closer through
      telecommunication. </P>
    
    <P>We strongly believe that the 3PN has the potential to
      vitalize communication between young Armenians in the world, to open new
      horizons for Armenian education, and to contribute to the health of
      Armenian culture in its homeland and around the world. </P>

    <P> A- Personnel and organizations: </P>
    
    <P> - The 3PN is fortunate to have a group of volunteers
      and professionals, all very motivated, highly qualified and dedicated.
      This group has already devoted many hours to developing this project, and
      is ready to continue its efforts to ensure the success and quality of the
      project. See the section entitled &quot;Resumes of the Three Pomegranates Team
      Members&quot; and the list of the Three Pomegranates support team members. </P>
    
    <P> - Volunteer services offered by groups such as college professors and
      educators as well as by parent committees from some of the participating
      schools. </P>
    
    <P> - The collaboration with I*EARN, Inc. (the International Education and
      Resource Network) a not-for-profit corporation, founded in 1990. I*EARN is
      a national and international network of elementary and secondary schools
      linked by telecommunications. The I*EARN International assembly consists
      of 14 Centers (1), as well as smaller sites in 32 countries of the world.
      The purpose of the telecommunications work within I*EARN is to enable
      students to participate in joint projects where they can investigate areas
      of mutual concern. These joint theme-based projects focus on making a
      meaningful contribution to people, society and/or the planet. The 3PN is collaborating with the I*EARN - USA center: </P>
    
    <P>I*EARN-USA Director: Edwin H. Gragert, Ph. D. 475 Riverside Drive #540

    <P> - Layout and design work will be reviewed and commented by
      professionals in this field on a volunteer basis. </P>
    
    <P> A- In addition to the active support of individuals and organizations,
      the 3PN has the following resources: </P>
    
    <P> - The Ani and Narod Memorial Fund, Inc., e4d institute's parent
      organization, is offering an initial budget of $15 000 for the 3PN, as well as in-kind contributions. The Ani and Narod
      Memorial Fund will also consider the &quot;matching funds&quot; granting
      method. </P>
    
    <P> - Availability of basic computer equipment and capacity to support
      Internet technology in five of the ten participating schools. Two of these
      schools already have their own web pages on the Internet. </P>
    
    <P> - The e4d institute is offering a 300 MHz Pentium II server which
      will be used specifically for the 3PN. </P>
    
    <P> - The Amicus Networks, founded in 1994, a privately held company
      headquartered in Austin, Texas and the leading provider of Extranets (also
      known as Extended intranets) is offering to the e4d institute its
      software product called Tool Belt, secure Network Operations Center and
      consulting to design and implement Extranets. The Tool Belt suite of
      products includes a fully integrated set of Intranet features: bulletin
      boards, conferencing/chat, RealAudio, live and archived video,
      messaging/e-mail, broadcast communications, HTML content pages, database
      search and query, forms handling and user tracking. This software will be
      incorporated in our project and be used for hosting chat rooms,
      maintaining user profiles and organizing Email directories on the
      Internet. </P>
    
    <P> - Full acceptance and dedication of all the ten Armenian schools to
      this project: All the ten Armenian schools have agreed to participate in
      the 3PN (letters of agreement from each of the schools
      are available upon request) as well as to dedicate at least one and a half
      hour per week to it, as part of the official school program, integrating
      the project in the school curriculum. </P>
    
    <P> - Collaboration with &quot;Agn&quot;, the official school journal of
      The Sourp Hagop Armenian school in Montreal - Canada: This bilingual
      journal (Armenian and English) is published on a regular basis since 1996.
      The editorial group of &quot;Agn&quot; under the supervision of Mr. Mher
      Karakashian and Mrs. Hourig Attarian, has agreed to organize and implement
      the third activity of the 3PN. The third activity of the
      project which consists of &quot;the global magazine&quot; will be a Web
      version of Agn, however the content of the magazine will not only be
      limited to the Sourp Hagop school's students output but the work of all
      the ten participating schools. </P>
