          items or to look around to see if you can find products you might be
          interested in. You will find it easy to reach different pages within

          useful, but also to make them fun and attractive. A well designed site
          makes use of graphics and text to make pages lively without slowing
          them down or creating clutter. Icons and colors can help you know
          where you are within the site, or where certain links will take you,
          while creating a welcoming atmosphere. </FONT></P> </TD>

          <BR> </B>A site is &quot;sticky&quot; if it finds ways to keep you
          coming back to it, to hold your attention and to spark your curiosity.
          Some e-commerce sites are sticky because they have some new content
          every time you visit; they suggest interesting products based on what
          you have looked at so far; and they remember your preferences and
          personalize the site for your use. </FONT></P> </TD>

          <BR> </B>A Web site can be quick in many ways, such as loading
          quickly or being easy to understand even with a fast glance. But one
          of the most important ways an e-commerce site can be fast, is by
          keeping to a minimum the number of clicks it takes to get to a
          product. Well designed sites get you from the home page to an item you
          are curious about with only a couple of  clicks.</FONT></P> </TD>

          you feel the site gives you enough information about the products you
          are interested in?
          <BR> </B>When you go to a regular store you can usually touch and
          feel the product you are interested in and find out quite a bit of
          information about it before buying. In a bookstore, for example, you
          can flip through a book and read parts of it. The best e-commerce
          sites also give you enough background information, specific data and
          images of the product, that you feel comfortable about buying it
          online.</FONT></P> </TD>
