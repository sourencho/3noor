        <P>Dear teachers,</P>
        
        <P>Ask any student what he or she thinks about learning. Nine out of
          ten will tell you there are a lot more interesting and enjoyable
          things to do, like playing games with fellow students. </P>
        
        <P>If I ask you to join an Internet-based project, it sounds serious,
          doesn&#146;t it? But what if I asked you if you would like to play a
          game on the Internet with students all over the world? That&#146;s far
          more challenging, isn&#146;t it?</P>
        
        <P>Activity II clearly pursues specific educational goals, but students
          need to know only the gaming aspects of the project. I am confident
          that most students will be thrilled to play a challenging worldwide
          game, one which will show their own queries, as well as players&#146;
          scores on the Internet, for all to see.</P>
        
        <P>Thus Activity II will create a fair amount of enthusiasm, for at
          least its run of six weeks. Your students are the players while you,
          the teacher, can make their &#145;playground&#146; look as attractive
          as possible.</P>
        
        <P>If you have any questions or comments, please do not hesitate to
          write to:</P>

        <P><B>THE STRUCTURE OF THE GAME</B></P>
        
        <P>Before going through this document, you should take a close look at
          the instructions of the identity game, and familiarize yourself with
          its rules. Here is a synopsis of the Identity Game:</P>
        
        <P><I>Educational objective:</I> To give students a glimpse of the
          physical, social and cultural environment of their global peers, while
          encouraging them to give a revealing portrait of their own.</P>
        
        <P><I>Mechanics of the game:</I> Participating teams answer four
          questions (out of a list of seven) about their city in an effort to
          reveal its identity without giving any obvious clues. Each team then
          attempts to guess the secret identity of the other teams&#146; cities.</P>
        
        <P><I>Purpose of the game:</I> To gain as many points as possible by
          having other teams guess your city&#146;s identity, while guessing as
          many of the other teams&#146; identities as you can.</P>
        
        <P><I>Players:</I> There are currently 30 teams in the game, each team
          representing one of the 30 participating schools. These are divided
          into six groups, each group represented by a different color. Within a
          group, there are five teams whose identities are hidden (each team is
          represented by one of five animals). The game is played between the
          five teams in each group. Teams within a group do not interact
          directly with teams in other groups.</P>
        
        <P><I>The day after the game is over:</I> When each team submits its
          guesses about the identities of other teams within their group, a
          scoreboard is displayed, and the winners are announced. Since the game
          is played between the teams of each group, it would be interesting to
          check the answers and results of teams within other groups, and to
          reflect on the insights gained into other cities.</P>
        
        <P>&nbsp;</P>
        
        <P><B>AREN AND THE TEAM REPRESENTATIVES</B></P>
        
        <P>Who runs the Identity Game? Aren is a fictitious figure, with a
          graphic representation, an e-mail address and even a personality. His
          role is to interact with students, explain the game, help them
          participate creatively, and resolve conflicts. Students should be
          encouraged to turn to Aren with questions, suggestions, and
          preliminary ideas regarding their answers. All final answers should
          also be sent to Aren. Aren&#146;s address is: aren@narod.org.</P>
        
        <P>Each team should have one or two representatives who will ensure a
          smooth dialog between Aren and the team members. These representatives
          will check and distribute Aren&#146;s e-mail messages, help team
          members send their questions, comments and results to Aren, and
          regularly check the Activity II schedule and deadlines.</P>
        
        <P>Please send your class representative&#146;s e-mail address (if
          different than your school&#146;s NNP'99 e-mail address) to Aren as
          soon as possible.</P>

        <P>We realize there&#146;s no &#145;best&#146; way to complete this
          project. The circumstances in your school might be very different than
          those of other schools. The way the project will work in your class
          depends on criteria like:</P>
        <UL>
          <LI>amount of time for the project</LI>

        <P>* Starter game:</P>
        
        <P>A starter game could be a small one-lesson introduction game like:
          every student tries to write an honest description about him/herself
          on a card without any &#145;give-aways.&#146; While the cards are
          mixed, every team member receives a shuffled card and reads out the
          description out loud, trying to guess an identity. The teacher talks
          about: which description was too difficult (contained too little
          information); and which card was too easy (contained too much or
          give-away information).</P>
        
        <P>In short, the starter game might help formulate questions, and
          teachers will find it useful to refer to the game throughout the
          duration of Activity II.</P>
        
        <P>&nbsp;</P>
        
        <P><B>WORKING IN SUB-TEAMS</B></P>
        
        <P>Some of the questions of the Identity Game ask students to describe
          an individual experience such as the daily trip from home to school.
          However, each team is asked to give only one answer to each question.
          How can you reconcile the collective effort of the team with the
          individual answer required by the Identity Game? Here are some
          suggestions regarding group work:</P>
        
        <P>&nbsp;</P>
        
        <P><I>Group work in general</I></P>
        
        <P>For students, working in groups can be a joy. Seeing the results of
          their labor following six weeks of intensive collective effort can
          also be highly rewarding.</P>
        
        <P>Note, however, that placing four students in a sub-team doesn&#146;t
          automatically make each member an integral and equally committed part
          of the group. You, the teacher, need to guide students in recognizing
          and appreciating the individual qualities and strengths of sub-team
          members. Similarly, each sub-team member must learn to respect both
          the group and group decisions.</P>
        
        <P>You could ask the sub-teams to show you not only the final results,
          but also a clear view of how the sub-team has divided tasks and
          responsibilities among members.</P>
        
        <P>&nbsp;</P>
        
        <P><I>Group work: how to organize sub-teams</I> </P>
        
        <P>Let&#146;s say there&#146;s a class of 28 students who will work on
          the seven questions. </P>
        
        <P>Since the class as a whole will be responsible for the answers, it&#146;s
          recommended that the final answers and first draft be assessed by the
          entire class. <B>By the same token, as the game requires that the
          participating teams answer four out of seven questions, the final
          submissions could be voted on by the entire class.</B> The process
          will entail a fair amount of compromising and, ultimately,
          consensus-building. </P>
        
        <P>One way of facilitating this leg of the activity could be to divide
          the class into seven sub-teams of four members each, according to a
          lottery system of pulling colored straws. An even better option would
          be to let the students form their own groups. Each group will be
          responsible for one question, by free choice or picking a question
          through some kind of lottery. Some questions require special computer
          skills like graphic editing, and their success will depend on the
          amount of help you can provide.</P>
        
        <P>&nbsp;</P>
        
        <P><I>Group work: how to maintain a clear view of the group work
          process</I> </P>
        
        <P>Teacher-student discussions can be quite useful in streamlining the
          process or coming up with alternatives. As mentioned before, you could
          ask sub-teams at certain phases to conference with their teacher.</P>
        
        <P>The following two suggested strategies for working collectively are
          just one obvious way of doing it. It would be good to have a more
          creative example as well, to make them aware of the fact that there
          are indeed many ways of having a group produce one answer:</P>
        
        <P>For instance, in the case of a question for which students have to:</P>
        <UL>
          <LI>make a picture: Instead of making one picture, each sub-team
            member could make a suggestion about a possible subject. After
            agreeing on four subjects, each member prepares a photograph, which
            could be taken by either a digital or conventional camera. Photos
            could be scanned in later. Each member brings in his or her photo.
            The group then decides which work to use for the Web</LI>
        </UL>
        <UL>
          <LI>write a part: By overviewing the final text, it&#146;s hard to
            determine what each individual student has contributed to the end
            result. Each member could be asked to write his or her text, and the
            sub-team may show all the texts to the teacher. Afterwards the
            sub-team would submit a final text, containing an edited version of
            all the individual texts. An interesting way to accomplish this is
            to make use of word processors with each individual text written in
            a different color. The final text will contain four colors, each
            representing one sub-team member.</LI>
        </UL>
        
        <P>&nbsp;</P>
        
        <P>So, again, the project is not merely about the final result, but the
          PROCESS of getting there, the way students come up with questions and
          answers. Was it only one student who did all the work? Or did the
          students manage to divide the work between sub-team members? Having
          told your students about the significance of collective effort, you
          might also encourage sub-teams to explain to the class how and why
          they have arrived at their particular answers.</P>
        
        <P>Students must also be made aware of the importance of meeting
          deadlines.</P>
        
        <P>If you have a small class, or there is extra time available, you
          could organize smaller sub-teams or give each sub-team more questions.
        </P>
        
        <P>&nbsp;</P>
        
        <P><B>CORRECTIONS (NOT TO BE MADE) BY TEACHERS</B></P>
        
        <P>The difference between normal group work in your classroom and
          publishing the questions of Activity II on the Web is that &#145;the
          whole world&#146; is now able to see the results of your students&#146;
          work, a fact that calls for a more conscientious effort and product
          precision.</P>
        
        <P>Be that as it may, we strongly appeal to you not to touch up or
          correct your students&#146; work for the sake of posting perfect
          presentations. It&#146;s important that students are able to
          communicate in their own way, through their own expressions, pictures
          and words.</P>
        
        <P>Of course this doesn&#146;t mean that you are not allowed to pick up
          signals from students about mistakes. Sooner or later one of your
          students will notice a misspelling or a strange word. That might be
          the right moment to point out that it&#146;s up to THE STUDENTS to
          maintain quality control. You&#146;ll notice during the project that
          students will become increasingly critical of their own work, as they
          realize that the final results of their effort is their own
          responsibility, not their teacher&#146;s. You might suggest an &#145;editing
          phase&#146; to steer students toward coming up with their own
          solutions, like sub-teams correcting sub-teams before publishing.</P>

        <P><B>HINTS ON THE SEVEN QUESTIONS</B></P>
        <OL>
          <LI>Students might want to combine stories for a better group effort.
            Some students may concentrate on writing, others on photography.</LI>
          <LI>Students could try out their images on fellow students or
            parents.</LI>
          <LI>All four students could write a story. Why not combine some
            stories into a work by an imaginary writer?</LI>
          <LI>A traditional cassette recorder will do. After the final
            selection is made, just plug in a microphone in the soundcard of a
            multimedia computer and play the cassette in front of the
            microphone. Since sound files tend to get large and are harder to
            transmit over the Web, try to limit recording time to 10-15 seconds.</LI>
          <LI>Students might write individual descriptions of a meal. Then all
            the pieces will be compared and finally incorporated into one
            description.</LI>
          <LI>Try to let your students find different kinds of maps and make
            comparisons. In addition to scanning in printed maps, students also
            might explore the vast map resources of the Internet. Do not forget
            to remind your students to use their own judgment when they copy a
            document from the Internet and to mention the reference sources
            used. </LI>
          <LI>It might take some time before your students find a conversation
            they like. Once the group has collected and written down several
            items, you could ask them to select the most interesting parts, and
            join them into one final conversation.</LI>
        </OL>
        
        <P>&nbsp;</P>
        
        <P><B>DEADLINES</B></P>
        
        <P>As you can see in the schedule, Activity II comes with a number of
          deadlines. We realize projects like these might interfere with
          everyday classroom activity, but playing the game will be rewarding
          only if every teacher participating in the project keeps up with
          deadlines. Also bear in mind that it takes one irresponsible student
          to spoil the fun for the whole class; it is up to you, the teacher, to
          enforce deadlines so that all students benefit from the project. </P>
