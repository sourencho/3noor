        suggest that you divide your class into groups of students (i.e. four
        groups of five students each). Having a functional group structure will
        be convenient when Activity III - Presentation - begins. Groups can work
        in parallel on the same exercise, or can work on different complementary
        parts of a task.</FONT>
        <BR>
        <BR><FONT SIZE="-1">Try to establish a routine for using email and
        accessing the Web. Perhaps a group of students can take responsibility
        for cheking the Student Page bulletin board and the Schedule for new
        announcements and events, as well as email received at the school
        address from the Narod Network participants or visitors. For cases where
        students have Internet access at home, they could access the site from
        home as part of the established routine.</FONT>

        <BR><FONT SIZE="-1">Please make sure that you identify the email

        This address will appear in the school contact information accessible
        from the World Map page.</FONT>

        <BR><FONT SIZE="-1">Please send  me your comments to all of the above

        way which is appropriate to your particular needs and context.</FONT>
