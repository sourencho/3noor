        the Nov/Dec 1997 issue of AIM magazine, there is an article about a &quot;rising
        tennis star from Armenia... ranked 72 in the world.&quot; But we are not
        sure this is his correct current ranking. There is also confusion about
        his date of birth...
        <BR>
        <BR>1. First we need to verify the player's name and his real ranking
        in the ATP (Association of Tennis Professionals) top 100 ranked single
        players as of November 1997.</FONT>
        <BR>

        player from his Web site? Where is he playing next?</FONT>
