              videoconference was more formal in nature than the first. It took
              place as part of the AGBU Manoogian Demirdjian School annual
              festival on May 31, at half past noon, Los Angeles time. With a
              twelve hour time difference, this meant that it was past midnight
              in Yerevan, where they had entered the following day, and were
              already in the month of June. The Students in Yerevan could not be
               present at that hour. Instead they were represented by the
              principal of school #198, Justice Minister David Harutyunyan and
              Anahit Voskanian, the teacher in charge of the 3PN at the school.

              Lou Papazian, who was in Yerevan at the time. Students in Los
              Angeles took advantage of the video and voice connection to ask a
              series of questions which Mr. Harutyunyan answered in a
              spontanious and engaging manner.</FONT></P>
