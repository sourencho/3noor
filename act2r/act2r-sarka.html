        <BR>Sourp Sarkis is an Armenian religious tradition that has been
        celebrated for many years. It is a unique holiday that requires a lot of
        self sacrifice. Sourp Sarkis is also a time of festivity in many
        Armenian houses especially in those homes that include a family member
        with the name Sarkis or Mardig.
        <BR>
        <BR>Sarkis the strong (zoravar) lived during the fourth century. By
        Rome's ruler, Gostantianos Sarkis would be the General of Gabatovgio ,
        that was his birthplace. Sarkis who was a loyal Christian takes his son
        and decides to go to Armenia. But his presence in the Armenian castle
        may have turned into a reason to cause a war between the Armenian and
        the Greeks. To avoid a potential war they go to Persia, where King
        Shabouh the second (310-379) happily admitted him and made him the
        general of the Persian-Roman borders. He had many victories. Shabouh the
        second learned about the spread of Christianity and invited Sarkis the
        strong and his son to his palace. Sarkis accepted the invitation and
        decided to show his true beliefs.
        <BR>
        <BR>Sarkis the strong didn't pay homage to the Persian gods and the
        palace officials killed his son and sent Sarkis to a dungeon far away
        from town, with a plan to cut off his head .The King's wish was done.
        Fourteen Christian soldiers under Sarkis' army decided to go and
        honorably bury Sarkis the strong, those soldiers were later killed.
        Other Christian soldiers tried to find Sarkis' body and they tried to
        take it to Asorick. Because of all the Sarkis, his son Mardiros, and all
        the fourteen soldiers were made to Saints. In the Fifth Century Mesrop
        Mashdoths tried to take his body to Armenia. The Armenian society have
        ever since named churches after Sarkis and Mardiros.
