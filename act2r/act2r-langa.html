        <P>LANGUAGE/ALPHABET/LITERATURE</P>
        
        <P>The official language in the Republic of Armenia is Armenian
          (Hayeren). Russian is also widely used. Major Western languages, such
          as Spanish, Italian, German, French, and especially English are</P>
        
        <P>included in the public school curriculums, and are extensively
          taught in most colleges and universities.</P>
        
        <P>The Armenian language is an independent, one-language subgroup
          within the Indo-European language family.</P>
        
        <P>Armenian alphabet, which consists of 39 characters, was created in
          405 AD by a monk named Mesrop </P>
        
        <P>Mashtots (the original alphabet had 36 letters, three were added
          later). The first work of literature with </P>
        
        <P>the new alphabet was the translation of the Bible from Greek. This
          has been regarded as a masterpiece by many linguists. During the
          centuries the dialect into which the Bible was translated became the
          standard language - grabar, or Classical Armenian.</P>
        
        <P>During the centuries, the dialect into which the Bible was
          translated became the language - grabar, or Classical Armenian.
          Numerous literary works, both original and translations, were written
          in that period in grabar. Many works in Classical Greek, Latin and
          other languages exist today only in their Armenian translations. A
          unique collection of priceless ancient documents is preserved in the
          National Depository of Manuscripts, the Matenadaran, in Yerevan. First
          printed documents appeared in Armenia in early 16th century. A century
          later, in 1662, an cleric, Father Voskan was sent to Amsterdam by
          Catholicos Hakop, to prepare printing of the Bible in Armenian. For
          years later, the job, which consisted of casting Armenian letter
          types, producing wooden carvings for the illustrations, etc. was
          completed, and the first Bible in the Armenian language was printed in
          Amsterdam in 1662.</P>
        
        <P>Armenian literature began to develop with the creation of the
          Armenian alphabet in 405-406 AD and the subsequent translation of the
          Bible into Armenian. Amongst the first texts to be translated and
          studied were those of the great Greek philosophers, politicians and
          theologians. The study of these ancient thinkers allowed for the
          deprovincialization of the Armenian culture. It also helps to explain
          why the first texts written by Armenians are neither naive nor
          primitive. One such early piece was the epic poem &quot;David of
          Sassoun,&quot; celebrating the efforts of the Armenian bravemen who
          fought against Arab domination and for the freedom of the Armenian
          people. The oldest form of poetry, the hymn of religious inspiration,
          has played a major role in Armenian literature for centuries. This
          lyrical poetry, a combination of poetry and chant designed for use in
          religious services, has been written by the Armenians since the 5th
          century. </P>
        
        <P>Religious lyricism reached its pinnacle in the 10th century with the
          works of Grigor of Narek. His masterpiece, the Narek, is one of the
          most widely read works in Armenia. </P>
        
        <P>The 12th century witnessed the rise of yet another summit of
          medieval lyricism in the person of Nerses Shnorhali (the Gracious).
          This Catholicos left his Lamentations on the Fall of Edessa and many
          sharakans, or hymns, used in the Armenian mass. Grigor and Nerses
          lived and worked during the &quot;Golden Age&quot; of Armenian
          literature as the art of writing was flourishing. It was toward the
          end of this period (1095-1344) that poetry, including poems on love
          and other secular themes, began to appear and grow as an important
          force in Armenian literature. </P>
        
        <P>In the 13th and 14th centuries, Constantine of Erznka began to write
          poetry of spring, love, light and beauty, images which he
          allegorically exalts the great mysteries of Christianity. In
          Constantine one can see a broadening of the poetry, a movement away
          from more rigid ecclesiastical terminology and toward a freer, more
          open use of language. In the 15th and 16th centuries, love poetry came
          to exist in Armenia. Basically common to all Eastern literatures, love
          poetry and its forms were recreated in Armenia, a country that had no
          such tradition behind it. Nahapet K'utchak embodied this new movement
          in poetry. </P>
        
        <P>This new poetic form continued to the time of Sayat Nova. This
          greatest of writers composed in Armenian, Azeri and Georgian, singing
          of courtly love and the unattainable beauty of the beloved. The death
          of Sayat Nova, in 1795, came on the brink of the modern era. At this
          time in history, the world was becoming increasingly integrated.
          Armenian children were being educated in the universities of Europe. A
          new spirit emerged, a lay spirit. Works once thought to be vulgar,
          written in the laic tongue of the commoner, finally attained the
          dignity literature. New genres such as the novel, the ballad and the
          short story were born as Armenians were affected by the currents of
          rationalism, symbolism and decadence encompassing Europe; but, the
          themes of these works remained traditionally Armenian. Authors wrote
          of the land and its peasant customs, the coveted fatherland, and the
          yearning for freedom. </P>
        
        <P>The nineteenth century beheld a great literary movement that was to
          give rise to modern Armenian literature. The veritable creator of
          modern Armenian literature was Khatchatour Abovian (1804-1848).
          Abovian was the first author to abandon the classical Armenian and
          adopt the modern for his works, thus ensuring their diffusion.
          Abovian's most famed work, The Wounds of Armenia, returns to the theme
          of the Armenian people's suffering under foreign domination.
          Khatchatour Abovian dedicated his life to writing and educating others
          on the subject of Armenia and her people. </P>
        
        <P>The Armenian national movement was given impulse by yet another
          great writer. Raffi (Hakop Melik-Hakopian) was the grand romanticist
          of Armenian literature. In his works, Raffi revived the grandeur of
          Armenia's historic past. In the story &quot;Gaizer,&quot; the heroes
          fight for the liberation of their people. This theme of oppression
          under foreign rule is also evident in the works &quot;Djelaledin&quot;
          and &quot;Khente.&quot; </P>
        
        <P>The literary tradition of Khatchatour Abovian and Raffi was
          continued even as Armenia came under Communist rule. This revival of
          tradition was carried out by such writers and poets as Hovhaness
          Toumanian, Yeghisheh Charentz and the like. This revival took place
          under the Communist system, much restricting the freedom of expression
          of the writers. </P>
        
        <P>In the late 1960's, under Brezhnev, a new generation of Armenian
          writers emerged. As Armenian history of the 1920's and of the Genocide
          came to be more openly discussed, writers like Paruir Sevak, Gevork
          Emin and Hovhaness Shiraz began a new era of literature. </P>
