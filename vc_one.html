              Yerevan &#150; Marseilles &#150; Los Angeles videoconference was 
              a collaboration between the students during which they answered 
              each other&#146;s questions regarding the locations and details 
              of Armenian monuments. The students would find images of these monuments 
              in Armenian Web sites, and would use the whiteboard to draw their 
              locations on a map of Armenia, while they exchanged information 
              via the video link and text in Armenian. The 3PN 
              is collaborative experience that began in January of 1998 as NNP&#146;98, 
              linking ten Armenian schools in Armenia, France, Lebanon, Canada 
              and the United States through the Internet. Participating students 
              spend one or two sessions every week working on activities specially 
              designed to acquaint them with each other, with the Internet, and 
              with their Armenian heritage.</FONT></P>

              Marseilles; and the AGBU Manoogian Demirdjian School, Alex Pilibos
              Armenian School, and Chamlian Armenian School in Los Angeles. The
              Armenia node of the conference was made possible by Arminco, the
              Internet Service Provider in Yerevan, under the project management
              of the 3PN Yerevan technical coordinator, Ana 
              Karakhanian. Arminco volunteered substantial technical and human
              resources to this event, and hosted more than twenty participating
              students in Yerevan. In Los Angeles, students used computer
              facilities at the Manoogian Demirdjian School, as well as a second
              node at the Alex Pilibos computer lab. Teachers in charge of the
              3PN, Aram Chouljian, Minas Kojayan, Nazareth
              Apanian and Saro Nazarian participated actively. In Marseilles,
              France, students gathered at the Hamazkain School, supervised by
              the 3PN technical coordinator Arsen Karabajakian
              and the school&#146;s principal, Loussine Malikian.</FONT></P>

            <P><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="2">Originally scheduled for 30
              minutes, the conference lasted almost one-and-a-half hours due to
              the excitement of the participating students. In addition to the
              planned exercise, students exchanged greetings as well as general
              cultural, social and personal information over the video link, in
              an atmosphere of fun and intense collaboration. One of the high
              points of the conference occurred when a student in Yerevan asked 
              to see one of her counterparts in Los Angeles, with whom she had
              been exchanging email and collaborating through the 3PN. Marie Lou Papazian, the e4d institute director pointed
              out that fulfilling this kind of need for a visual and personal
              contact was exactly the kind of complementary functionality that a
              videoconference brings to the global activities of the 3PN. &quot;It is also significant,&quot; pointed out
              Papazian, &quot;that the oral and written interaction between
              students naturally took place in Armenian, despite the
              predominance of English on the Net. The only language common to
              these kids in Armenia, France and the US is Armenian.&quot;</FONT></P>
