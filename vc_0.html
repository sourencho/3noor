            <P><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="2">On May 9<SUP>th</SUP>, 1998 we implemented 
              our first Internet videoconference between students in Yerevan, 
              Los Angeles and Marseilles. This was the first ever Internet videoconference 
              between Armenia and the rest of the world using live video in addition 
              to voice, a &quot;chat&quot; session in Armenian, and a &quot;whiteboard&quot; 
              for interactive drawing. This event was followed by two other <A HREF="nnplaunch.html" TARGET="_top">3PN</A> videoconference sessions. Several weeks later, 
              on May 31, the 3PN teacher from one of the participating 
              schools in Yerevan joined the school&#146;s principal and Justice 
              Minister of Armenia David Harutyunyan in the second videoconference 
              event. They connected to 3PN students in Los Angeles 
              joined by an audience composed of the general public gathered for 
              the AGBU Manoogian Demirdjian School annual festival. On June 28 
              it was the turn of the Sourp Hagop Armenian School in Montreal and 
              the M. &amp; H. Arslanian Djemaran and Yeghishe Manookian schools 
              in Beirut to hold the third 3PN Internet Videoconference. 
              During this final videoconference of the session the Montreal and 
              Beirut nodes were joined by the Project coordinators from Los Angeles 
              who participated in the multimedia exchanges with students and faculty.</FONT></P>
