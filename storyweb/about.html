        <P>On May 9<SUP>th</SUP>, 1998, Armenian students from the United
          States, France and Armenia participated in an Internet
          videoconference. During more than an hour, they collaborated using
          video, voice, a &quot;chat room&quot; in Armenian and a shared online &quot;whiteboard&quot;.
          Their common task was to find Armenian monuments and landmarks on the
          World Wide Web, to locate them on a map of Armenia, and to test
          each-others&#146; knowledge about them. This was one of the high
          points of the current Narod Network Project (NNP &#146;98). Started in
          January of this year, NNP &#146;98 links ten Armenian schools in five
          countries in an educational network. During a period of six months,
          students from participating schools devote one or two class hours
          every week to a set of Web based activities specially designed to
          acquaint them with each-other, the Internet and their shared Armenian
          heritage.</P>
        
        <P>This document briefly describes some key aspects of the Narod
          Network Project and outlines our plans for NNP &#146;99, its upcoming
          expansion phase. We will attempt to present the motivation behind the
          Narod Network, its educational content and organizational structure,
          as well as the human and technical resources involved in it.</P>
        
        <P>&nbsp;</P>
        
        <P><B>Introduction</B></P>
        
        <P><B></B></P>
        
        <P>The Internet is recognized as an important factor in creating and
          reinforcing a global culture. This unifying instrument, often sited as
          one of the most positive developments of new telecommunications
          technologies, is also accused of having a negative homogenizing
          effect. But the Internet, while acting as a forum for the encounter of
          cultures, also has the potential of reinforcing each of them. We
          believe that it is precisely those cultures most in danger of
          disappearing through assimilation into more predominant local
          identities, which have most to gain by building a global critical
          mass. Armenians have existed in a globally dispersed state for many
          generations. We are convinced that this project will contribute to the
          unification of the different manifestations of Armenian culture, and
          that it will help demonstrate the potential of the Internet for
          sustaining heterogeneous identities. </P>
        
        <P>A prime objective of this more fluent communication between
          Armenians is to bring the intellectual and human resources of diaspora
          Armenians to Armenia, providing it with a permanent educational
          resource. At the same time, diaspora Armenians can benefit from this
          virtual connection with the physical source of their cultural
          heritage. Armenia has a demographic density of Armenians and a level
          of Armenian cultural activity unequaled anywhere in the Diaspora. It
          also has a future as a national entity, which is much more long-term
          than that of any given Armenian organization. A very large number of
          Armenians have never been to Armenia and know little about what it
          means to live there, yet many consider Armenia their other homeland.
          This project aims to explore how diaspora Armenian students and
          students in Armenia can contribute to the sustainable development
          Armenian culture and education worldwide.</P>
        
        <P>&nbsp;</P>
        
        <P><B>The precedent: NNP'98</B></P>
        
        <P>The 1998 Narod Network Project (NNP'98) is an innovative Internet
          based educational project that began in January of 1998. It links ten
          Armenian schools in five countries around the world (Armenia, Canada,
          France, Lebanon and the United States.) For a trial period of six
          months, NNP'98 provided students between the ages of 12 and 18 the
          opportunity to collaborate on activities designed to introduce them to
          Information technology, to each-other, and to their shared Armenian
          heritage. The students spent approximately two class periods per week,
          lead by one or two teachers, collaborating on the different project
          tasks, using Armenian as the main working language.</P>
        
        <P>After overcoming the usual technical barriers and witnessing the
          reaction and feedback of the participating schools, we are now
          confident that this is a highly beneficial and viable effort both from
          an educational perspective and in terms of its contribution to
          Armenian cultural awareness. Due to the devotion and enthusiasm of
          students, teachers and principals at the participating schools, the
          Narod Network Project of 1998 has set an innovative and successful
          precedent for an &quot;Armenian School Network&quot;.</P>
        
        <P> </P>
        
        
      <P>NNP'98 can be accessed through the e4d institute's bi-lingual (English 
        and Armenian) home page at <B>www.3noor.org</B>. The results of NNP'98 
        has been posted.</P>

        <P><B>Goals, Structure and Methods</B></P>
        
        <P>The Narod Network Project uses telecommunications technologies to
          create a learning network of Armenian schools worldwide. By creating a
          critical mass of interconnected schools in Armenia and the Diaspora
          the NNP aims to achieve the following objectives:</P>
        <UL>
          <LI>To broaden the perspectives of Armenian students around the world
            by making them aware of their peers in different countries.
            <BR> </LI>
          <LI>To supplement the traditional curricula of Armenian subjects in
            schools with more novel and alternative materials and methods.
            <BR> </LI>
          <LI>To create a culture and infrastructure of communication between
            different schools in order to obtain a forum for the exchange of
            ideas and the development of educational programs.
            <BR> </LI>
          <LI>To train students and teachers in the use information and
            telecommunications technologies in general and the Internet in
            particular.
            <BR> </LI>
          <LI>To help those students who are fluent in Armenian in using the
            Armenian language on the Internet, and to help those who are not
            fluent in Armenian to maintain their connection with their Armenian
            peers.
            <BR> </LI>
          <LI>To contribute to the unification of Armenian curricula, and to a
            mutual transfer of technological and cultural resources between
            Armenia and the Diaspora.
            <BR> </LI>
          <LI>To provide Armenian educational material to students who do not
            attend Armenian school, and to give those students a point of
            contact with other Armenians in the Diaspora and in Armenia.
            <BR> </LI>
          <LI>To become a benchmark for the use of telecommunications
            technologies in dispersed and minority cultures worldwide.</LI>
        </UL>

        <P>The Narod Network Project targets a wide constituency composed of
          students, teachers, parents, school boards as well as sponsors and the
          community in general. Each of these has a vested interest in the
          Project, complementing those of the e4d institute. In turn, the
          Project provides benefits in the form of resources and services to
          each of these. The table below outlines the investments and benefits
          concerning direct participants in the Narod Network Project.</P>

        <P><B>Pedagogical principles and objectives</B></P>
        
        <P>The e4d institute is in the process of constantly developing and
          enhancing a basic set of pedagogical guidelines, a network of
          professional consultants and expert advisors as well as core
          educational material and databases. The basic principals and objective
          which are the result of the Institute&#146;s experience to date,
          include the following.</P>
        <UL>
          <LI>Maintaining an innovative and motivating approach to educational
            material. Education should enhance students&#146; and teachers&#146;
            perspectives, should be hands-on and encourage creativity and
            initiative-taking.</LI>
          <LI>Transmitting Armenian subjects as living and exciting material to
            students. These subjects should be seen as relevant to students&#146;
            daily lives and broader interests, and should go beyond
            stereotypical studies of folklore and traditions.</LI>
          <LI>Promoting the use of the Armenian language outside Armenia both
            as an important tool for accessing the Armenian cultural and social
            heritage and as a link with Armenia and Armenian communities in the
            global Diaspora.</LI>
          <LI>Catering to students who do not attend Armenian schools in order
            to include them in the community of young Armenians who share common
            values and cultural ties.</LI>
          <LI>Being sensitive to cultural differences and special social
            circumstances both within Armenia and between different communities
            of the Diaspora.</LI>
          <LI>Building up a basic set of resources of readily accessible
            educational material for students and educators. Each project should
            build on and contribute to a growing set of educational resources.</LI>
          <LI>Strengthening the ties between Armenia and the outside world.
            Exposing students in Armenia to the rest of the world, and giving
            Diaspora students access to resources in Armenia.</LI>
          <LI>Encouraging multidisciplinary study by providing source material
            to a wide range of subjects within schools. Tapping into the human
            and other educational resources in different school departments.</LI>
        </UL>
        
        <P>&nbsp;</P>
        
        <P><B>Curriculum integration: towards a flexible common framework</B></P>
        
        <P>Our approach in designing the Narod Network Project is based on the
          principals of a phased approach and a complementary relationship with
          existing institutions, schools and educational or technological
          initiatives. The aim of the Project is not to form a closed network of
          schools, but to build common grounds for leveraging and amplifying the
          input of teachers, institution and students in a unifying framework.
          In particular, at the basis of the Narod Network Project are two
          principals regarding the educational curricula of participating
          schools.</P>
        <OL>
          <LI>The Project makes no attempt to impose or replace educational
            content in participating schools. The reasons for this are simple.
            The e4d institute does not have the resource or pedagogical
            qualifications to take on basic curriculum design. Just as
            importantly, because it deals with a global constituency of
            participating schools, the Project must respect the diversity of
            educational techniques and pedagogical content inherent to each
            institution. Rather, the e4d institute relies on a team of highly
            qualified consultants, including educators at the schools
            themselves, to provide a framework for amplifying existing
            curricula, giving local resources a global reach, and providing
            educational material and contexts for the implementation of the
            teaching activities already targeted by each school.
            <BR> </LI>
          <LI>On the other hand, one of the aims of the Narod Network Project
            is to help set the basis for curriculum integration in Armenian
            subjects across schools. It is our belief that by sharing certain
            educational materials, activities and methods, schools in Armenia
            and in the Armenian diaspora will enjoy the advantages of a common
            critical mass of curriculum design. Just as important is the link
            that the Narod Network Project establishes through the Internet
            between participating students. This inter-student contact has a
            unifying function across schools, and is an educational process in
            its own right.</LI>
        </OL>
        
        <P>&nbsp;</P>
        
        <P><B>The expected contribution: What is in it for students and
          teachers?</B></P>
        
        <P>The Narod Network Project aims to add value to the educational
          programs of participating schools in the following ways.</P>
        <UL>
          <LI>Students will establish contact with their counterparts in
            different schools around the world. These contacts have the
            potential of being maintained and nurtured through ongoing
            communication over the Internet, by personal contact or through
            other complementary projects.
            <BR> </LI>
          <LI>Student will gain further insight into Armenian culture and
            language, as well as the current realities of Armenians living in
            different parts of the world. In particular, students in Armenia and
            in the Armenian diaspora will learn about their respective
            lifestyles, finding as many shared aspects and differences.
            <BR> </LI>
          <LI>Both students and teachers will receive an intensive introduction
            and hands experience regarding the Internet, the World Wide Web and
            their related technologies. They will become acquainted with
            techniques for finding and publishing information on the Web. In
            particular, they will find out about the Armenian aspects of the
            Internet, from seeking out Armenian Web sites, to exchanging email
            in Armenian.
            <BR> </LI>
          <LI>Teachers will also have at their disposal a wealth of
            information, resources and contacts that they can readily assimilate
            into their teaching program. From reading material found on the
            Narod Web site&#146;s Storyweb (see below) or social and cultural
            information in different communities, to suggested topics and
            activities with Armenian themes.
            <BR> </LI>
          <LI>Teachers and students who participate in the Narod Network
            Project naturally become trainers and instructors to the rest of
            their school&#146;s pupils and staff. For those who typically have
            little or no prior experience with the Internet, or with Information
            Technology in general, the Narod Network Project is an effective and

        <P><B>The Armenia connection</B></P>
        
        <P>The Participating schools in Armenia have proved to be some of the
          most active participants in the Narod Network Project 1998. This has
          in part been due to the role of Armenia as an obvious focal point of
          the emotional and cultural ties linking Armenians together. Also,
          because of their inherent enthusiasm for hard-to-find technological
          resources and their natural facility with the Armenian language, the
          participating students in Armenia have contributed to the level of
          excitement and the educational content of the project.</P>
        
        <P>This active participation, however, must be contrasted with the low
          quality of Information Technology and telecommunications equipment
          available to the schools in Armenia or in most Armenian homes. During
          the course of NNP &#146;98 students from the two participating schools
          in Armenia have had access to the United Nations Development Program
          (UNDP) center in Yerevan where they have conducted their weekly NNP
          sessions. In NNP &#146;99, we plan to add at least two more schools in
          Yerevan, and possibly in other parts of Armenia. The most likely
          scenario, in terms of connectivity for these schools, will be a
          continuation of the NNP &#146;98 model. Possible candidate sites are
          well-connected educational or social centers such as the American
          University of Armenia, the UNDP center, or a school equipped with
          special telecommunications technologies.</P>
        
        <P>For the Narod Network Project, the active involvement of Armenian
          schools is crucial because of the following benefits.</P>
        <UL>
          <LI>The transfer of technological know-how, pedagogical methods and
            management skill into Armenia.</LI>
          <LI>The contribution of the participants from Armenia in terms of
            their linguistic and cultural aspects.</LI>
          <LI>The positive impact of the Project as a prototype or proof of
            concept for complementary initiatives.</LI>
          <LI>The advantage of tapping into the under-exploited human resources
            in Armenian in terms of both technological contributions and
            pedagogical content.</LI>

        <P><B>The Partnership &quot;contract&quot; with schools</B></P>
        
        <P>By its very nature, the Narod Network Project is a partnership with
          the participating schools. As we point out elsewhere in this document,
          the e4d institute provides the technology, programmatic activities
          (exercises, content, software&#133;), the necessary training for
          teachers and the staff, as well as the maintenance systems and the
          organizational for the Project. We are convinced of the importance of
          including the Project in the schools' programs by integrating it in
          their curricula. Additionally, the e4d institute requires the
          following of participating schools:
          <BR> </P>
        
        <P>- To devote at least two class periods per week to the project
          activities.</P>
        <UL>
          <LI>Assign one or two teachers in charge of the project.</LI>
          <LI>Register for the NNP'99 by completing an official registration
            form (sample available upon request).</LI>
          <LI>Pay the contribution fee of $500/year (this fee is waved in some
            cases such as for Armenia.)</LI>
          <LI>Approve a two-year commitment to participate in the Narod Network
            Project.</LI>
          <LI>Ensure telephone lines and Internet access within the school.
          </LI>
          <LI>Devote the necessary computer infrastructure and facility where
            available. The e4d institute will subsidize schools that cannot
            afford the necessary infrastructure by contributing Hardware and
            software and/or connectivity.</LI>

        <P><B>Training activities</B></P>
        
        <P>The Narod Network Project 1998 confirmed that for the effective use
          of information and telecommunications technologies, as well as for
          logistical purposes, it is important that each school have a &quot;facilitator/coordinator&quot;
          assigned by the e4d institute or the school. This person should be
          based in the area where the school is located. The
          facilitator/coordinator will be responsible for the local day-to-day
          training of the teachers and school staff, assisting them in the
          implementation of the project, troubleshooting, as well as supervising
          and coordinating certain aspect of the work.</P>
        
        <P>In addition to the local facilitators/coordinators, one global staff
          member will conduct general training throughout the project using
          online instruction, local focused training sessions as well as a
          general training workshop during the 1999 NNP seminar. This general
          training will target two groups: teachers within schools and parents
          in public awareness-building sessions. The goals of this ongoing
          training activity are:
          <BR> </P>
        <UL>
          <LI>Motivating teachers and school staff.</LI>
          <LI>Instructing teachers on different aspects of the project and
            assisting them in implementing their curricula within the Narod
            Network Project framework, and helping organize the Narod Network
            classroom in their school.</LI>
          <LI>Collecting feedback and input from teachers, staff and parents.</LI>
          <LI>Interfacing with parents and the general public by regularly
            distributing informative newsletters, organizing public
            presentations and/or workshops and getting parents' input and
            comments. </LI>

      <P>NAROD NETWORK PROJECT 1999</P>
        
        <P><B>An overview of the Project content and activities</B></P>
        
        <P>NNP &#146;99 is divided into three consecutive activities running
          from the Beginning of October 1998 to the beginning of June 1999.
          (Schools in the Southern Hemisphere, namely in Argentina and
          Australia, will participate in a more extracurricular mode in December
          and January.) Students will spend one or two weekly sessions for a
          total of 1&#189; to 2 hours every week on the Narod Network Project.
          The first of the three Activities is designed to bring participants up
          to speed with the use of the Internet and related technologies and
          tools. The second aims to familiarize students with one another, and
          with the social, family and community contexts of their fellow
          students in different countries. The third is a collaborative activity
          culminating in the production of a global guide to the focal points of
          modern Armenian history and culture in Armenia and the Diaspora. Below
          is a brief description of each of these activities, stating each
          activity&#146;s objectives, implementation details and some
          illustrative examples. This section is followed by the description of
          a pilot initiative to target Armenian students in the Diaspora who do
          not attend Armenian day schools, with the aim of expanding the Narod
          Network Project to include that important segment by the end of 1999.</P>
        
        <P>&nbsp;</P>
        
        <P><B>Activity 1 &#150; &quot;Networks&quot; (4-6 weeks):</B></P>
        
        <P>GOALS: The goal of this activity is to introduce students to the
          Internet and the World Wide Web, to familiarize them with the tools
          they will need during the course of the project, and to train them on
          the use of Armenian on the Net.</P>
        
        <P>MEANS: Students will follow an introductory tutorial and perform the
          following exercises:</P>
        <UL>
          <LI>Sending email to team members in other participating schools</LI>
          <LI>Using a Web page design tool to produce and upload a personal
            page</LI>
          <LI>Producing multimedia email attachments such as image, audio or
            video files</LI>
          <LI>Searching for specific information on the Web</LI>
        </UL>
        
        <P>EXAMPLES: The search exercises will consist in helping solve an
          imaginary problem by finding information on the Internet. For example,
          the students could be asked to help a foreign company establish its
          product development operations in Armenia. Can they find the address
          of a patent lawyer in the city of Gyumri<SUP>*</SUP>, or a translator
          from English to Armenian, on the Internet? More specifically, they
          will be asked to organize the &quot;First Annual Mashtots Avenue
          Festival&quot; with resources from the Web.</P>
        
        <P>&nbsp;</P>
        
        <P><B>Activity 2 &#150; &quot;People&quot; (8-10 weeks):</B></P>
        
        <P>GOALS: The goal of this activity is to introduce participating
          students to one another, and to expose them to daily life in countries
          other than their own. By finding out about the social realities,
          family structure and community context of their peers, participants
          can gain a broader and more global perspective, while becoming
          personally acquainted with the students with whom they will
          collaborate during the project, and hopefully even beyond it.</P>
        
        <P>MEANS: In order to elicit a franc exchange of information and
          capture the interest of students, this activity will take the form of
          an interactive game. Rather than asking students to introduce
          themselves directly, the game will consist of several rounds during
          which students have an opportunity to reveal both objective data about
          their family and social context, as well as their concerns, interests
          and ambitions. The game will be designed to achieve three
          complementary effects: (1) To ensure that students examine and
          familiarize themselves with other participants&#146; contributions,
          (2) to avoid having students &quot;paint a rosy picture&quot; of their
          environment, or simply transmit a stereotypical image of their
          culture, and (3) to make the whole process fun and exciting for the
          students.</P>
        
        <P>EXAMPLES: Although the actual nature of the acquaintance game is
          still under development, there are several candidates which satisfy
          the above requirements. One of these is a guessing game whereby
          participants reveal incomplete information about themselves,
          challenging others to guess which city they are located in. In a
          subsequent round, this picture will be completed, revealing the
          details of life in that city. For example, students will be asked to
          describe a current event in their city which is of concern or interest
          to themselves or their parents, but which may not be known to the
          outside world. Place names or other obvious clues might be omitted in
          this phase. Each participant will then have a chance to guess at the
          identity of the authors. Points will be gained by successfully
          guessing others&#146; identities or by legitimately hiding ones own
          form foreign participants while revealing it to compatriots. The
          questions can address a number of aspects from family structure,
          parents&#146; professions or expectations of the future, to
          preferences in entertainment, culture, etc. Students themselves can
          devise questions aimed at eliciting answers which are both revealing
          and of interest to them.</P>
        
        <P>GROUP I VERSION: Activity 2 includes a less demanding version of the
          acquaintance game designed for the younger (9- to 12-year-old)
          participants. Group I students will take on the task of generating an
          online &quot;quilt&quot;. Each of them will initially contribute a
          thumbnail image (approximately 1 inch by 1 inch) which is either a
          photograph of themselves, a drawing they have done, one of their
          favorite objects, or any other image that they would like to use to
          represent themselves. For each team, these images will be assembled
          into a quilt or grid of images. By clicking on any thumbnail image,
          participants and the general public alike will be able to access 
          information about the participating students&#146; lives, families,
          interests, etc., which they will add during each subsequent session.
          The game in this case will consist of trying to guess the location or
          identity of the students, which will be revealed in the last session
          of Activity 2.</P>
        
        <P>&nbsp;</P>
        
        <P><B>Activity 3 &#150; &quot;Places&quot; (16-20 weeks):</B></P>
        
        <P>GOALS: Activity 3 has three parallel goals. At one level, it will
          lead to the creation of a student-produced information resource about
          Armenia and Armenian communities around the world. At the same time,
          it will introduce students to a project-based, collaborative method
          and work ethics. And finally, it will educate them about the recent
          history and current reality of Armenia and the Diaspora in a novel
          way, complementing the more traditional history/geography/literature
          curriculum they are otherwise exposed to.</P>
        
        <P>MEANS: A map of the world will act as the visual reference for
          organizing the students&#146; work. Starting in August and up until
          the start of Activity 3, the Narod Network Project staff, volunteers
          and participating teachers will compile source material on places
          which are significant for Armenian communities in Armenia, in other
          countries of the Commonwealth of Independent states, and in the rest
          of the Diaspora. This compilation will be a synthesis of existing
          sources, and will include points of interest due to demographics, 
          current or historical socioeconomic and cultural centers, and
          important monuments or other structures. This database will be
          referenced to the dynamic (clickable) world map, and will serve two
          purposes: to directly educate the students regarding often neglected
          aspects of these focal points and, more importantly, to act as
          examples to students and teachers of the kind of material and style of
          presentation that students can use for their contributions. Students
          from teams of schools in different cities will then be asked to
          collaborate in completing and complementing the world map by following
          three phases:</P>
        <OL>
          <LI>Students will communicate over the Internet in order to decide
            which cities on regions they will work on (their own, those of their
            team partners, or others that they may decide to adopt.) During this
            phase, they will organize their work program for the following
            phase.</LI>
          <LI>Each week students will gather material (text, photos, video,
            anecdotes, ideas) about their target regions, in order to post them
            for review and processing by their team partners.</LI>
          <LI>With the material gathered during phase 2, students will organize
            and implement the presentation of their material which will then be
            linked to the dynamic map as a series of Web pages.</LI>
        </OL>
        
        <P>It is important to stress that the material produced by the students
          is not meant to be comprehensive or authoritative. The stress is on a
          positive and innovative work method, and on the kinds of results that
          offer novel insights both to the students and to their potential
          audience on the Web.</P>
        
        <P>&nbsp;</P>
        
        <P>EXAMPLES: The following are three hypothetical scenarios of Activity
          3 projects, describing some details of their successive phases by way
          of illustration.</P>
        
        <P>Scenario 1: Aftermath of the Genocide &#150; A theme-based example</P>
        
        <P>Hypothetical team: Boston, Yerevan, Beirut.</P>
        
        <P>Students in Boston, Yerevan and Beirut work on tracing the route of
          some Armenian families through their cities in the Aftermath of the
          Genocide. </P>
        <UL>
          <LI>NNP staff illustrate a fictional Armenian family&#146;s
            post-Genocide migrations based on K. Beledian&#146;s recent novel &quot;Semer&quot;.
            The novel begins with the author inheriting a box of old photographs
            which he uses to reconstruct the family&#146;s deportation from
            historical Armenia and their migration from Syria, to Greece,
            Lebanon and then France.</LI>
          <LI>Students in Boston contact the photography archive of Project
            Save in order to gather photographic source material on the lives of
            post-genocide families. They coordinate their search with students
            in Beirut who attempt to trace the path of families which arrived in
            Lebanon in the early 1920&#146;s and migrated to Soviet Armenia in
            the late 1950&#146;s. The trace is picked up by students in Yerevan
            who locate those immigrant families and document part of their
            experience. Did any of their sons and daughters end up in the Boston
            area? Students in Boston attempt to close the loop by finding traces
            of those families.</LI>
          <LI>As material is gathered and the search progresses, the students
            upload their findings and unanswered questions to the site. Fellow
            students from other teams are encouraged to contribute by asking
            their family members for leads. Finally, the findings are referenced
            to the world map as an open-ended multimedia presentation.</LI>

        <P>Scenario 2: Armenian business ventures &#150; A comparative example.</P>
        
        <P>Students in Yerevan, Los Angeles and Buenos Aires compare and
          contrast Armenian-owned businesses in the Diaspora and businesses in
          Armenia owned by Diaspora Armenians. </P>
        <UL>
          <LI>NNP staff present examples of a variety of Armenian-owned
            businesses in traditional Armenian communities such as Fresno, and
            more remote locations such as Hong Kong. In parallel, they present
            new business ventures recently established in Armenia which have
            Diaspora ties. The operations of the businesses, their clients,
            ownership structure and suppliers are briefly explained.</LI>
          <LI>Students in Yerevan focus on some businesses, established by
            Diaspora Armenians, which they are aware of through their everyday
            interactions. They attempt to understand how these operate, and to
            interview their management or owners. Students in Los Angeles
            contact the US counterparts of some of these businesses or join
            students in Buenos Aires in documenting key Armenian-owned
            businesses in their cities, tracing their recent history, and
            understanding their place in the local economy.</LI>
          <LI>The results from these findings serve as the basis of a
            comparison of different businesses. In what aspects are they similar
            or different? What are the future plans or expectations of their
            managers or owner? What role do they play in the students&#146;
            daily life.</LI>

        <P>Scenario 3: Armenians in Europe &#150; A regional example</P>
        
        <P>Students in Marseilles, Michigan and Gyumri document one aspect of
          the Armenian presence in Europe/France in General, and Marseilles in
          Particular.</P>
        <UL>
          <LI>NNP staff give examples of key aspects of the Armenian presence
            in Italy, based on sources such as the AGBU Newsletter of February
            1977, including material on the Moorat-Raphaelian school and its
            present fate, the publisher of the &quot;Documenti di Architettura
            Armena&quot; and Key personalities in Rome, Milan and Venice.</LI>
          <LI>Students in Marseilles propose to focus on a part of their city&#146;s
            recent history. A division of labor is established, whereby students
            in Michigan will work on researching the general background of
            Armenians in France based on books and online resources; Gyumri
            students take on production tasks such as write-ups, Web page design
            and drawing a map; and students in Marseilles commit to going on a
            field trip to one of the famous tenement housing blocks which housed
            the first Armenian immigrants to Marseilles, take pictures of it,
            and interview some of its former tenants. A schedule is established
            and work begins.</LI>
          <LI>Students exchange material and information about their progress,
            getting feedback from each-other. Work-in-progress is uploaded to
            the project site and available for all to see. Once the
            information-gathering phase is completed, the team completes the
            presentation of the material, and the resulting set of Web pages is
            linked to the world map.</LI>
        </UL>
        
        <P>GROUP I VERSION: Activity 3 includes a less demanding version
          designed for the younger (9- to 12-year-old) participants. Group I
          students will be asked to populate the world map, and particularly the
          cities of their team, with virtual institutions, buildings and places.
          For example, students in Sidney may &quot;design&quot; their ideal
          music conservatory, draw a clickable picture of the building, describe
          its programs, and schedule, as well as the curriculum vitae of a
          visiting piano teacher from Armenia, provided by their team partner in
          Yerevan. Students in Yerevan might &quot;build&quot; a new zoo, choose
          its location on a clickable map of the city, and ask students from
          participating schools in different countries to send them scanned
          images of one of their indigenous animals to populate the virtual zoo.</P>
        
        <P>&nbsp;</P>
        
        <P><B>Two age groups</B></P>
        
        <P>NNP &#146;99 will be divided into two groups by age. Each school can
          choose to participate in one or both of these age groups.</P>
        
        <P>Group I: 9- to 12-year-old students</P>
        
        <P>Group II: 12- to 18-year old students</P>
        
        <P>The project contents and activities are different for each of these
          age groups. Although the general theme of the activities are the same,
          the level of initiative expected from the students and the type of
          material they are expected to produce are adapted to the expected
          interests and abilities of the groups.</P>
        
        <P>&nbsp;</P>
        
        <P><B>The team structure</B></P>
        
        <P>Due to the increasing number of participating schools, the NNP &#146;99
          participants will be divided into teams of three schools for Group II
          (12- to 18-year olds) and teams of two schools for age Group I (9- to
          12-year-olds). The routine interaction among the students of schools
          within a team will be more intense during the course of the project
          activities than the interaction among students across different teams.
          However, in order to give students the broadest possible exposure to
          other participants, cross-team interactions will also be encouraged on
          a more informal basis, as well as through tasks specifically designed
          to encourage exchanges across teams. </P>
        
        <P>One criterion for the grouping of schools into teams is diversity.
          Given that approximately one-third of the schools are located in
          Armenia, and another third in the US, most Group II teams will include
          one school from each of those two countries, and another from a third
          country. A typical team might combine Yerevan, Los Angeles and
          Marseilles, or Gyumri, Boston and Buenos Aires. </P>
        
        <P>&nbsp;</P>
        
        <P><B>Internet videoconferencing</B></P>
        
        <P>One tool which we intend to use much more extensively in NNP &#146;99
          is Internet videoconferencing. Each team of three schools will use
          Internet videoconferencing where possible in the context of the
          project Activities. The videoconferencing sessions will serve several
          objectives:</P>
        <UL>
          <LI>To complement the students&#146; personal acquaintance through
            email by establishing real-time contact, including video and voice.</LI>
          <LI>To familiarize students, teachers and staff with one of the more
            advanced aspects of communication technologies using the Internet.</LI>
          <LI>To enhance the process of collaboration on project tasks by
            facilitating face-to-face dialogs.</LI>
        </UL>
        
        <P>&nbsp;</P>
        
        <P><B>A note on extracurricular demands</B></P>
        
        <P>The activities of the NNP put a premium on personal initiative and
          extracurricular efforts, specially on the part of students, but also
          for the participating teachers and coordinators. This does not mean,
          however, that the NNP relies heavily on time spent by the students
          outside of the 1&#189; to 2 hours dedicated to the Project per week.
          While encouraging and rewarding extra effort, the NNP ensures that the
          required tasks can be carried out within the classroom context,
          through the following measures.</P>
        <OL>
          <LI>The NNP activities will complement existing class subjects
            whenever possible. Armenian language classes, geography or history
            classes, computer lab hours, etc., can use the NNP as a hands on
            application of their regular curricula. In this way, the Project
            will have the benefit of material generated and tasks undertaken in
            the context of those classes.</LI>
          <LI>The NNP Web site will provide a list of online resources which
            facilitate the students&#146; research from within the classroom
            and, in some cases, from the students&#146; homes. These resources
            include email addresses of academic and other specialists in
            universities and institutions around the world, who have volunteered
            to act as occasional mentors during the course of the project. Also
            available to the students will be a list of Web sites relevant to
            the activities they are involved in, and other basic references and
            tips on how to make the best use of them.</LI>
          <LI>NNP activities always begin with a set of sample tasks and
            suggested projects, many of which do not requires extracurricular
            effort or the availability of first-hand sources. While some
            teachers may be able to direct students to the more open-ended
            examples, others may decide to adopt a more controlled subject,
            stressing a creative approach and a deeper analysis, rather than
            putting the stress on exploration and generating original material.</LI>

        <P>ADDITIONAL FEATURES</P>
        
        <P><B>Project alumni and publication task force</B></P>
        
        <P>Currently, only one class participates in the Narod Network Project
          from each school. This means that students who participated in the
          Project in the previous year may not have a chance to build on the
          skills and experience they gained and the contacts they established
          during the course of the project. In order to address this problem,
          the e4d institute has initiated an Project Alumni program which aims
          to maintain the continuity across NNP participants of different years.
          This program has three main features in NNP &#146;99:</P>
        <UL>
          <LI>An NNP participant email directory. Those students who
            participated in NNP &#146;98 and who do not have email addresses of
            their own, will receive an email address from the e4d institute.
            Both those addresses and the particular email addresses of students
            who already have their own, will be listed in the Project Web site
            in order to facilitate contact between students.
            <BR> </LI>
          <LI>The Student Page. NNP alumni will continue to have access to the
            Narod Network Project Student Page, through which they will be able
            to communicate with their peers through public postings.
            <BR> </LI>
          <LI>The NNP Publication Task Force. NNP &#146;98 participants did not
            have a chance to complete the third and final activity initially
            programmed for them. This consisted in producing a publication
            (online and/or on traditional media) which documented and analyzed
            the results of the first two activities of the project. The e4d institute will now provide a small group of NNP &#146;98
            participants in a number of participating schools support in
            completing the publication activity as an extracurricular effort.
            This &quot;Publication Task Force&quot; will be an experimental
            self-organizing group coordinated by a teacher or project
            coordinator in each school, with the assistance of the NNP staff.</LI>
        </UL>
        
        <P>&nbsp;</P>
        
        <P><B>Pilot track for students of non-Armenian schools</B></P>
        
        <P>The e4d institute targets different segments of the young Armenian
          population around the world. In order to best assess the impact of its
          programs, the Institute relies on different segmentation schemes, by
          geography, age, access to media, schooling, language skills and
          dialects. Two of the important segmentation schemes to consider for a
          program such as the Narod Network Project are language and schooling.
          By maintaining a completely bilingual site in Armenian and English the
          NNP has made a commitment to address both those who are fluent in
          Armenian and those who can only access the project in English (limited
          resources have not permitted the consideration of languages other than
          English at this stage.) However, the Project has primarily been
          targeted to students attending Armenian schools, with close
          collaboration with the participating schools, and heavy reliance on 
          regular weekly sessions in the classroom.</P>
        
        <P>The e4d institute has now initiated two parallel efforts to expand
          the NNP target audience to students who do not attend Armenian
          schools. The first initiative involves partnering with US and
          International organizations in order to participate in educational
          programs aimed at linking students from schools in Armenia with
          students from schools in the US and other countries. The second
          consists of including, in NNP &#146;99, a pilot track explicitly aimed
          at student not attending Armenian day schools. These could be young
          Armenians participating from home, students attending Saturday or
          Sunday schools, or students of public schools who join the Project in
          an elective track.</P>
        
        <P>&nbsp;</P>
        
        <P><B>The Pilot Track</B></P>
        
        <P>The pilot track runs through all three activities of the Narod
          Network Project and is open to any and all 9- to 18-year-olds wishing
          to participate through the Internet. This track has a more organized
          nature when it comes to Group I, the pre-teenagers, and a looser, more
          flexible nature for Group II, the teenagers. This choice is based on
          the fact that the Group II activities require more personal initiative
          and can support varying levels of involvement, while the Group I
          versions offer more guidance and support to the students, and need a
          certain level of organization. The NNP staff will actively work to
          recruit Pilot Track participants with varied and representative
          backgrounds and geographic locations.</P>
        
        <P>The following are two scenarios describing hypothetical developments
          of the Pilot Track for Group I and Group II students respectively.</P>
        
        <P><U></U></P>
        
        <P>Group I Pilot Track Scenario &#150; The special quilt</P>
        
        <P>Several students from a public school in Los Angeles, students from
          Saturday schools in the US, Paris, Melbourne, Milan and Uruguay, as
          well students connecting from home in different locations, sign up to
          build a special quilt similar to the one described in Activity 2
          above. 40 students sign up in total, and begin contributing thumbnail
          images and related material about themselves for a quilt composed of a
          7x7 grid of 49 squares. 9 squares are left open for participants who
          might join in later in the year. 16 more participants appear during
          the year, such that the quilt is expanded to 7x8, and is published on
          the Internet along with the ones produced by the regular participants.
          The more active Pilot Track participants then go on to participate in
          Activity 3 during which they build a virtual movie studio in Armenia,
          with visiting actors, directors and writers from the home counties of
          all the participant.</P>
        
        <P><U></U></P>
        
        <P>Group II Pilot Track Scenario &#150; Friends in Fresno</P>
        
        <P>A small group of teenagers in Fresno, California follow the progress
          of one of the regular participating teams studying the Migration of
          Armenians to the US in Activity 3. They propose to join in by
          providing source material on families in Fresno and by giving
          assistance and suggestions to their adoptive team. The regular Team
          then asks the group in Fresno for specific information on a family in
          that city which now has relatives in Yerevan. The Fresno group
          interviews that family, and uploads an excerpt from the resulting
          audio file to the Web. Other Pilot Track participants form their own
          international groups, or work individually or in a school activity
          setting to link additional information to the world map of Activity 3.</P>
        
        <P>&nbsp;</P>
        
        <P>CONCLUSION</P>
        
        <P><B>A Final word on motivation</B></P>
        
        <P>One of the most entertaining and, at the same time, informative
          contributions to the Narod Network Project was a submission sent at
          the end of April by a participating student from Yerevan. Under the
          title of &quot;Lezoo yev Barabar&quot; (Language and Dialect) this
          14-year-old student, who had never used a computer until several
          months ago, had produced, digitized and uploaded a sound file to the
          Internet. In it, he had recorded the same phrase (a simple greeting)
          in six different dialects from different regions in Armenia, prefacing
          each one with the name of the corresponding region, in his own voice.
          This is just one example of the everyday impact of the Narod Network 
          Project. Contributions such as this sound file, or a Los Angeles
          student's map of Armenian institutions in the San Fernando Valley, or
          a survey of fellow students undertaken by a group in New Jersey,
          illustrate a number of the project's criteria: Students learn about
          the technology, and their heritage; a valuable resource (on dialects,
          for example) is made available on the Internet; and the school's
          educational programs find a far-reaching outlet for their activities.</P>
        
        <P>On a more macro level, the sum total of all the students', teachers'
          and staff contributions, together with the process of collaborating on
          the Project activities, clearly leads to an invigorating cohesion
          among schools. We see the Narod Network Project's mission as
          contributing to a complete and open network of Armenian schools, an &quot;extranet&quot;
          linking students and teachers together, both within and across
          borders. By leveraging and amplifying the efforts of Armenian
          educators, institutions and schools worldwide, we can reach a critical
          mass of educational activities which can make a substantial difference
          in the upcoming years.</P><HR>
