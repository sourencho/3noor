                house to your school. It should be one continuous sentence --
                you can use commas but not full stops. You can refer to what you
                observe during this trip, like the kinds of trees or animals you
                see, the smells you smell, perhaps what you think about... But
                remember, no hints like street names or famous locations.

                <BR>
                <BR>Like every morning, she is wondering about all those people
                busily moving back and forth along the street at that early
                hour, when the school bus arrives, with the name of her school
                written large in two languages on its side, picks her up and
                makes its way along the wide boulevard where policemen stand at
                intersections, telling cars to stop or go, ignoring the traffic
                lights, and then turns into a neighborhood of streets so narrow
                you would think it would get stuck there, passing noisy, crowded
                markets, chicken, rabbits and geese in cages, as she wonders
                about the smell of cooking already filling the streets, only to
                come out again into the wide and congested boulevard and finally
                enter the school yard where she finds herself in a different
                world, so quiet, calm and clean, compared to the city outside.</FONT></FONT>
