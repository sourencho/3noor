    <BLOCKQUOTE>&quot;I have a birthmark on my leg too! And when I was little,
      I used to tell stories about it... I chose the name Hratch because that's
      the name of one of my friends, and he also has a birthmark, except it's on
      his arm. I have always dreamt of going around the world in my small car, a
      Citr&ouml;en 2 CV. I call it Doudoun. But Doudoun seems to want to stay
      where it is these days... I love all kinds of chocolate, except the ones
      with almonds. Ice creams too, of course. You can write to me at
      <A HREF="mailto:6618@dm.net.lb">6618@dm.net.lb</A> and tell me what you
      think about my story.&quot; -<I>Hasmig</I> </BLOCKQUOTE>
