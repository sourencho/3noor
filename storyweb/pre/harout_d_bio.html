    <BLOCKQUOTE>&quot;After inventing bedtime stories for Lori, I decided to
      start writing them down. 'Sail' is one such story. I tremendously enjoyed
      taking Lori to places that only existed in my imagination. She enjoyed the
      ride. I hope you do too. Most people enjoy kites as kids. I discovered
      kiting at the age of 37! Kiting can be a lot of fun. It can also be very
      relaxing. The kite used in this story is called a &quot;Tri-D&quot; and
      was invented in 1977 by Peter Lynn of Australia. Kites come in a variety
      of shapes, forms and sizes. Being an architect I find myself attracted
      more to three dimensional kites rather than flat ones. There are lots of
      nice books on kites. If you're interested in a list, just 'drop me a line'
