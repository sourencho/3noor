                perhaps even a drawing to let the other students know what your
                city has to offer its residents when they are not working&#133;

                <BR>It may seem that there is not much to do in our city if I
                tell you that many of us often go to our local club on Sundays,
                and spend the whole day there, talking, playing and kidding
                around. There are not just us there, but people of all ages,
                from kids running in the club's small but shady garden, to an
                old woman shouting &quot;Bingo!&quot; as she gets lucky at the
                game. Members of the club's Women's Association bring foods like
                &quot;mante&quot; or &quot;dolma&quot; that everybody enjoys for
                a very small fee, and then the grown-ups have coffee, while us
                friends go to the basketball court to play or practice. We often
                need to practice for an upcoming game with the rival club, &quot;the
                others&quot;. We don't leave the club until late in the evening,
                knowing that we will all see each other the next morning at
                school.</FONT></FONT>
