        of Komitas.</FONT>
        <BR>
        <BR>Komitas (Soghomon Soghomonian), was born in 1869 to a poor family
        living in K&uuml;tahya (Turkey), whose members spoke only Turkish. A
        short while after being orphaned in 1881, he was sent to study at
        Ejmiatsin. Very rapidly, he was attracted by the folksongs of
        neighboring Armenian villagers. He graduated from the Ejmiatsin seminary
        in 1894, became a vardapet (doctor in theology) in 1896, continued his
        musical studies in Berlin for three years, then returned to Ejmiatsin.
        In 1910, he moved to  Constantinople where he founded a choir and a
        music school. In April 3, 1915, he gave a much acclaimed concert with
        his choir. Eleven days later, he was arrested and deported to the
        interior of the Ottoman Empire. In 1919, broken and mentally ill, he was
        liberated by his friends who brought him to Paris, where he died in
        1935, without ever fully recovering from his physical as well as
        spiritual ordeal.
