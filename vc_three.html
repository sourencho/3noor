            <P><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="2">Now it was the turn of the 3PN Schools in Canada and Lebanon to connect live
              through the Net. It was nine in the morning in Montreal and four
              in the afternoon in Beirut when the students of the Sourp Hagop
              Armenian School came online to greet the 3PN
              coordinator in Los Angeles. Assisted by Hourig Attarian and with
              the technical help of Antranik Kababejian and Mher Karakashian, 
              the Montreal students were ready to play the planned knowledge
              game on Armenian monuments and landmarks.

               Within minutes they were joined by the M. &amp; H. Arslanian
              Djemaran and Yeghishe Manookian students in Beirut, assisted by
              Jirayr Beujekian, the 3PN coordinator there.
              Soon photographs from Armenia were being displayed on the shared &quot;whiteboard&quot;,
              locations were being circled on the dynamic map of Armenia, and
              questions and answers were being exchanged either orally through
              the voice and video link, or written in Armenian in the &quot;chat&quot;
              area. The videoconference ended (again, going past the planned
              schedule) with a free-for-all whiteboard drawing session, and
              general conversation.</FONT></P>
